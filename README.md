# Draw-Convex
A C-implementation of the Graham Scan Convex Hull algorithm. The GUI is utilizing the Stanford Portable Library, listening for clicks from the user to add points and then drawing the one polygon that is the smallest that includes all those points. This was my final project for Programming I fall 2015.
